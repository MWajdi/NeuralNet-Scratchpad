# NeuralNet-Scratchpad
A hands-on project showcasing the development of a neural network from scratch. This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing the fundamental mechanisms of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent, all using pure Python and NumPy for educational purposes.
